Small project to track Executive Hangar Status in Starcitizen

The idea is to track the current status of the executive hangar where you have access to, like, where you have friends playing.

So you add a short descriptio, like shard-id and player-name and put the current status. The system is precise if you update the status when it just changed.

It will keep updating you with the current hangar status on those shards, so when you want to retrieve some ship, you know where to look at.

Just download the html and run in your browser.. it wont connect to any third party, just keep the data you input in your local storage.

Cheers, CBLASTER.
